- 👋 Hi, I’m @jimbojimface
- 👀 I’m interested in my homeserver and all the things it does for me, mainly through the medium of docker; zoneminder, homeassistant, jellyfin, etc. all through a reverse proxy.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning stuff
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing, I'm just doing this for my own amusement.
- 📫 How to reach me - please don't x
